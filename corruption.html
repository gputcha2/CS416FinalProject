    <p>Based on way the various countries in the world are arranged in the scatterplot shown, we can draw a trendline and clearly see that
        there is a correlation between the corruption of a country's government and the recorded levels of happiness.
    </p>
    <p>As a country's corruption perception levels go up, the happiness levels start to decrease.</p>
    <p>
        Also note that here, our x-axis runs from 100 to 0. This is because under the corruption perceptions index measure, 
        a lower value indicates higher levels of corruption. You can more about the corruption perceptions index <a href="https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2018">here</a>.
