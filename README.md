In this narrative visualization, I will try to investigate the potential factors contributing to a country’s happiness score - exploring the relationship between happiness and several factors that could affect it such as the economy, life expectancy and corruption in the government. This will be done using an introduction followed by 4 visualization scenes. In each scene, I will explore a different potential contributing factor and analyze the relationship with the happiness score. 


The data for happiness scores are from the World Happiness Report which was released at the United Nations. These "happiness scores" for each country use data from the Gallup World Poll. The primary question informing these scores is called the Cantril Ladder. This question has respondents evaluate their current life with a score from 0 to 10.


By the end of the visualization, the user should have a clear understanding of the different factors contributing to a country’s happiness score and how they are related.
