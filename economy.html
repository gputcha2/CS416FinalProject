        GDP and Income Group are some of the most widely used indicators of a country's economic health. We will try to analyze the 
        relationship between these factors and the happiness scores of countries.

    <p>Here once again, we can draw a trend line to observe the relationship between these two measures. It becomes very clear that
        there is a positive correlation between GDP and a country's happiness score.
