    <p>In this presentation, we will try to understand the relationship between a country's "happiness score" and a few economic, political and health-related factors.
    </p>
    <p>The data for happiness scores are from the World Happiness Report which was released at the United Nations. These "happiness scores" for each country use data from the Gallup World Poll. The primary question informing these scores is called
        the Cantril Ladder. This question has respondents evaluate their current life with a score from 0 to 10.
    </p>
    <p>We are going to explore how these happiness scores are related to the following factors.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Corruption Perception Index</b> - How corrupt a country's government is generally perceived to be</li>
        <li><b>Life Expectency</b> - Indicates several health factors such as quality of healthcare, general health, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Income Group</b> - The classification of a country into one of four broad income categories.</li>
        <li><b>GDP per Capita</b> - Provides a basic measure of the value of output per person in a country.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Along the way, we will highlight three countries: <b>USA, Zimbabwe, & Poland</b> and use them as a small-scale case-study to gain a clearer understanding of the 
        different trends we will observe.
    </p>
    <p>Observations on these countries will be in black on the scatterplots while other general observations will be shown in green.</p>
